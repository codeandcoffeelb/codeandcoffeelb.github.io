I am currently working with the following technologies and frameworks: ArcSight, Archer, SourceFire, FireEye, RSA Security Analytics (NetWitness), ForeScout CounterAct, CheckPoint Firewall, Juniper SA Series (VPN), Symantec Endpoint Protection, ISO 27001.  I have experience with the following technologies and frameworks: HBSS (McAfee ePO), Fortinet Firewall, CISCO Routers and Switches, eEye Retina, Nessus, PKI/PKE, Windows Security Center, WSUS, Server 2008/20012, Windows 7, STIG, SCAP, IAVA, DoD 8570, IAWF, WIP, DIACAP. 

I am a team player that works well independently with little to no supervision.   I’m hard working and dedicated.  I enjoy reading, researching and learning new things.   After joining this group, my goal is to learn Python and use it functionally by the end of the year.  One of my greatest strength is learning new technologies quickly and efficiently.  I am very glad have found this group and I am looking forward to learning multiple programming languages and have the opportunity to work with all of you.
