As host of Code + Coffee, LB, it makes my heart sing to see so many new faces mixing so well with those who've been attending a bit longer. For the past few weeks we've been doing a lot barn raising around here and I'm quite happy with what we've seen happen. 

First, we've got the makings of a community-built website. This site, right here. Built on Github Pages, Jekyll, and a custom domain name, inspired by [Uncoded][uncodedlb]. This use of Github for compiling a site with Jekyll, deploying and hosting on Github.io was a revelation to me and I soon realized it'd be a great way to get our attendees to dip their toes in the Github waters. And so our [Members][members] pages were born - a simple tutorial teaching the basics of Github workflow: clone, branch, edit a markdown file, commit, pull request, and you have your very own page on this site.

Second, we've got free coffee. No big deal, but it was kind of promised in the name of the event, so I figured we should start there.

Next, we've spun up a lot of other infrastructure. There's our active Twitter account, [@codeandcoffeelb][twitter] and our new [Facebook group][facebook]. As a group for coders, naturally we needed our very own [Github organization][github]. And finally, for realtime chat, we've got the [Code + Coffee Slack][slack]. Are we missing anything?

Finally, I want to make sure everyone is being well taken care of, so if there's anything we can do better please let me know.
