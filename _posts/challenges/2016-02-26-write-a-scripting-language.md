Writing your own scripting language is a fun challenge and a good exercise. If you ever wanted to
write your own "perfect" language, now's your chance!

Examples of some scripting lagnauges:
   - Bash
   - Python
   - Javascript
   - Lua
   - Perl
   - PHP

Examples of some less useful and smaller langauges

  - [Trumpscript](https://github.com/samshadwell/TrumpScript)
  - [Brainfuck](https://github.com/redevined/brainfuck)


Here's this week's challenge. Write a langauge! 

  - Give it a name
  - Give it an extension `(.txt, .py, .s)`

Your scripting language should be able to do the following:

  - Displays "Hello, World" (STDIO, Pop-ups, anyway you want!)
  - Display a green rectangle (anyway you can)
  - Compute FizzBuzz 

You can do this any way you wish. The more creative the better!
