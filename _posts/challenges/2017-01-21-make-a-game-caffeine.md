Coffee is a very important thing. We all need coffee. It keeps us awake while we drag ourselves out of bed to a 10 AM meetup.

So for this challenge, let's honor our favorite beverage by making games for it.

You're free to use whatever language or framework you'd like. Bonus points for
using something no one has heard of. 

## Rules
1. It has to run at least on your machine
2. It has to be demoable 
3. It has to end (there needs to be a win condition or end state)

## Resources

If you're new to game development, I recommend looking at [Love2D](https://love2d.org/).
It doesn't have a steep learning curve and you can get your first program running in minutes.
