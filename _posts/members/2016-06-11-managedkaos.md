I'm all over the map when it comes to computer technologies thanks to a short attention span.

I've done programming, circuit design, and a lot of system administration on Windows, Linux (mostly this lately), and even Unix (HPUX/Solaris/AIX)!

These days I'm what they call a Systems Reliability Engineer.  I make sure code gets deployed properly and then I monitor the sites to make sure they stay up and running.  When !#@$@% hits the fan, I'm the guy they call to clean things up.  Then I document what happened and take steps to make sure it dosen't happen again.  I currently have the AWS Solutions Architect and Developer certs at the associate level; I'm working on the SysOps Professional cert.

I'm also a contributor to Linked In Learning.  I've authored a few classes and I'm working on more.

Glad to be a part of the Code & Coffee crew because its a great space for bi-directional mentoring; I feel like a "seasoned" nerd learning from the younger folks on the team!  I'm also glad to share my experience with them.

I'm all over the social webs with a couple blogs, twitters, and instagrams covering tech and food.  Tune in and be amazed!  Or just LoL. :D
