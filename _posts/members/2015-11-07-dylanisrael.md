###Welcome,
**my name is Dylan C. Israel.**


I'm a computer science major at CSULA. I currently work as a freelancer for small companies and individuals mainly looking for web help. I'm also a gaming and eSports fan. Some of my favorite games include:

- Final Fantasy and pretty much any JRPG
- League of Legends
- Warcraft 
- Hearthstone

Sadly, I have very little time for video games. I spent the bulk of what free time I have working on my 
> [Youtube channel](www.youtube.com/pizzapokerguy87)

Its just a coding channel dedicated to free tutorials that I personally am doign for the first time and figuring out as well.
This is basically my first time using MarkDown and so far it isn't too bad. I'll look forward to messing with it more in the future.
