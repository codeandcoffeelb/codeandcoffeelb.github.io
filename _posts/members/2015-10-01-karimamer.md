I drink a lot of coffee and write a lot of code sometimes it will be clean and neat and other times it will be buggy and look old. Sometimes i will write in lisp , haskell , scala and python or be cool and use node but it doesn't matter if it's java i just like to code. I filter , map and reduce my thoughts on a daily basis and when get confused i flatmap and every thought just blows
