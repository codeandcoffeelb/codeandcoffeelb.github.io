I ALSO love ***Code and Coffee!*** I love it because i go there and I can code in peace!
And no one is laughing at you for being a nerd, they just say things like:

```javascript
var question = code_and_coffee_question;

for each (question) {
    var answer = question.overthink_question()
    console.log("akward downward glance",answer);

  }
```

1. "oOoOoOo Is that Node.JS ? thats cool can i see what you working on?"

2. " hey im starting up a side project using a MEAN stack, do you know anything about that?"

3. " Hey who is that weird James guy ?"

4. " Would you like to goto a JSLA meetup? im going soon and want to go with some other geeks"

#### Here is something im working on

```javascript

var mongoose = require('mongoose');
var socketioJwt = require('socketio-jwt');
var express = require('express');
var chickenSandwhich = slap_erik();
var TEMPLE_OS = require('temple_os');


var critiqueit_slaves = [
  {name : 'erik'},
  {name : 'ken'},
  {name : 'alex'},
  {name : 'fred'},
  {name : 'karim'}
];

slap_erik(critiqueit_slaves);

function slap_erik(critiqueit_slaves) {
    //loooool
  var me = this;
    // lulllz lullz
  var this = that;

  for(var slave in critiqueit_slaves){
    var slave = critiqueit_slaves[i];
    for(slave.name) {
        switch (slave.status)
          case 'runs':
            function assign_more_work();
          case 'wants to leave early':
            function handcuff_them_to_desk();
          case 'wants use their own libraries':
            function tell_them_no();
          case 'wants 2 write integration for temple OS'
            function pay_them_obscene_amounts_of_moneys();
