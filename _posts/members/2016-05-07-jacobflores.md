#Hello World

##My name is Jacob E. Flores



Fundamentally, I am a poet. One day, I would like to make technology that interfaces with the dreaming brain. 
I studied biomedical engineering and work 9-5 as a corporate drone in **I.T.**



### Here is a poem I wrote:
```
We step into Cartografia,	The city of What-ifHere, the Queen of Imagination rules with a Lavish Scepter,	Granting subjects every wish,		All their whims.Castle spires reach high,Poking their crowns into quasarsCollecting frost on their awningsThe streets are littered with discardedDaydreams.Songs that were sung for one summerAlone?Well they hang around on telephone lines.Nostalgia drips down the bark in the orchards, And memories seed the fields like wild oats.	A guess dashes through the 	grass	A criticism circles overhead, waiting	to strike.We walk under these royal violet skiesWe watch the circumstantial sun set	And the stars yawn wideAwake	The past lives of mitochondriacatcall at the 	future misfortuneof the New York Stock	Exchange.:”I’ve been an old soul	all my life”:.There’s a quarrel rustling In the bushes	Building tension	Living in the moment.Politics live here now,	Under these canopies ofHope,	Above these mangroves of Fear.If you listen close,With your breath held still,You’d swear you could hear The burping grunts of propaganda.And if you lay your head on the bank of the swamp,	you can feel the rhythmic drop of wartime boots		[.:*:.]A mockingbird snaps us 	Out of our eavesdroppingThe meadow of forgiveness is where We spend our night.	It is the sort of place that reinvigoratesthe soul of a child wholost their faith somewhere in a scantron.Dawn peeks over the edge of eternity  as if to say,“There is no forever,	there is only now.”We put in a request 	to go back home.	Queen Imagination grants our wish,	of course.We tumble through the Gates of Cartografia.	And through the ineffableWilderness,	We continue our search for   meaning.
